            <h3>worst droughts of the last two decades</h3>
            <p>Afghanistan is experiencing one of the worst droughts of the last two decades. Conditions are particularly severe 
                in the south, western and northwestern parts of the country. Water resources in these regions are severely reduced – 
                a major factor behind 19 million people – nearly half the country’s population – at crisis levels of food insecurity and poverty.
                The report maps out the drought and its affects, with detail on snow and rainfall, vegetation cover, groundwater and river flows,
                 harvests and livestock.</p>

            <h2>Global Warming and Afghanistan: Drought, hunger and thirst expected to worsen</h2>
            <p>While the nations of the world come together at the COP26 to seek solutions to climate change, Afghanistan is already suffering from global warming. One of the worst droughts in recent years has caused rainfed wheat crops to fail, led to plummeting livestock prices and shortages in drinking water. 19 million people – nearly half of the country’s population – are severely food insecure and require urgent assistance. AAN guest author Mohammad Assem Mayar,* a water resource management expert, maps out the severity of the drought and its effect on people and agriculture, explains how climate change will make drought in Afghanistan more common and looks at what should be done to mitigate their harm.

                <p>According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network’s (FEWS NET) snow cover monitoring maps, the shortfall of snow depth in Afghanistan on 1 March 2021 was even more extreme than in 2018, 
                    the third-worst drought in the last two decades. In this section, the author compares the current year’s data both with 
                    historical averages and the 2018 drought (see the past drought maps of Afghanistan here).
                    reduction in snow accumulation over winter decreases overall water volume and its distribution throughout the year.
                     Figure 2 shows snow water volumes – the amount of water in existing snow in the catchment – for the Helmand sub-basin in 2021
                      compared to 2020, 2018, and the long-term average, maximum and minimum circumstances, based on data since the year 2000. As 
                      
                      can be observed, the snow water volume in January 2021 is significantly lower than the usual average and at record lows from February 2021 onward, 
                      amounting to only 22 per cent of the usual snow water volume in the basin on 4 March. Water from the sub-basin drains to the Helmand River,
                       then crosses the border to Iran (and is at the root of a century-old conflict between the two countries, see here and here). 
                   depicts the streamflow graph for the lower Helmand station in 2021 in contrast to 2020 and normal circumstances. 
                   This graph shows a significant reduction in river flows in 2021 to extremely low levels (the green line), with shortages
                    reportedly affecting Afghanistan and Iran – Tehran has accused Afghanistan of cutting off its water supplies from the Kamal Khan dam reservoir (see this Pajhwok report). 
                   Drought-induced water scarcity affects agricultural productivity, livestock production, the availability of drinking water
                    and the capacity of hydroelectric power plants. In Afghanistan, agriculture, which consumes most of the water, is most severely affected.impoerant

                <p>Farmers across Afghanistan have been hit hard by drought and fighting in recent years. In this report, we look at how this has
                     affected agriculture in one province, Kandahar,
                     famous for its fruit production. Much of the fruit crop is – or should be – exported, yet the frequent and 
                     unpredictable closure of crossings into Pakistan has been an additional headache for farmers and exporters in the province. 
                     Those trying to dry and process food crops in Kandahar’s industrial park have also been hit by its collapse since the takeover
                      of Afghanistan by the Taleban. AAN’s Ali Mohammad Sabawoon has been hearing from farmers and others about the woes affecting Kandahar’s agricultural economy.</p>

            <p>The Earth’s climate crisis has been caused by developed countries.
                 The Paris Climate Agreement recognises this and requires them to compensate poor
                  countries for the effects of climate change through sponsoring adaptation initiatives.
                   That agreement recognises that countries like Afghanistan are suffering out of all proportion 
                   to the contribution they have made to damaging the planet’s atmosphere and climate. For Afghans, 
                   it is additionally unfair that the change of government means programmes backed by global funds are largely blocked
                    when the climate emergency is already hitting the country hard, causing hunger and distress. The need for adaptation
                     is urgent, yet the political impasse over aid and recognition looks to be enduring, and consequently also, the block on
                      most aspects of the major, globally-funded, already-agreed programmes. However, unlike all the other causes of crises 
                      facing Afghanistan, the climate change emergency will continue to worsen, regardless of whatever and whenever a political
                       settlement eventually materialises. </p>

↑1	The cause was what is called a Madden–Julian Oscillation event in December 2021.  This is an eastward moving disturbance of clouds, rainfall, winds and pressure that traverses the planet in the tropics and returns to its initial starting point after an average of 30 to 60 days. According to one study, it can result in a 23% increase in daily precipitation relative to the mean in Afghanistan.
↑2	A recent follow-up calEFERNCEl to Baghlan indicates that rainfed agriculture failed. A Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) map backs this up and also shows the failure of rainfed crops in Kunduz. Crops in Badghis, Faryab and Jawzjan provinces are faring better than last year.
↑3	The continuous movement of water in atmosphere (from vapour to liquid and solid phases) is called the water cycle. Water exists in the atmosphere as cloud vapours, and precipitate as rain and snow. Consequently, water flows on the earth before evaporating back into the atmosphere.
↑4	Gases that are emitted from the earth into the atmosphere and trap heat resulting in global temperature rises. Carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons are examples of greenhouse gases.
↑5	RCP pathways are adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to help modellers work out different climate futures, all of which are considered possible, but vary according to the volume of greenhouse gases emitted in the years to come. RCPs are labelled after their ‘radiative forcing value’, ie the size of the energy imbalance in the atmosphere – more incoming energy from sunlight than the earth radiates to space – as measured in watts per square metre, so RCP2.6 is a scenario with an imbalance of 2.6 W/m2, RCP4.5 an imbalance of 4.5 W/m2, and so on.
↑6	The four scenarios assume that: greenhouse gas emissions peak between 2010-2020 and then decline (RCP2.6); greenhouse gas emissions peak around 2040 and then decline (RCP4.5); greenhouse gas emissions peak around 2080 and then decline (RCP6) and; greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century (RCP8.5).
↑7	The regular reports, called National Communication are a requirement made by the fund called Green Climate Facility from all parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
↑8	The INDC represents a country’s steps to decrease national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.
↑9	As one example of climate change mitigation during the years of the Republic, under the Montreal Protocol, which sets binding progressive phase-out obligations for developed and developing countries for all the major ozone-depleting substances, including chlorofluorocarbons, halons and less damaging transitional chemicals such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). Afghanistan is committed to reducing its use of HCFCs, chemicals that are used in refrigeration and air conditions that destroy ozone layer and contribute to climate change, by 35 per cent of by 2020 and 67.5 per cent by 2025. To achieve this milestone, the Afghan republic’s cabinet in 2018 banned imports of HCFC-based equipment, which came into effect in November 2018. Following that, the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation was supporting the Afghan republic in training technicians for customs  to implement ban on HCFC equipment. In addition, Afghanistan once restricted importing vehicles more than a decade old , but then abandoned the rule because of the protests from traders, claiming they had placed orders for old cars and Afghans could not afford newer models.
↑10	For example, FAO and the Green Environment Facility joined forces in 2019 to implement the first-ever GCF-funded project in Afghanistan. It had focused on building the capacity of NEPA. Later, another proposal was submitted to extend this project for two more years. The implementation of these projects aimed at enabling NEPA to independently handle GCF-funding projects and lead government coordination on GCF projects. A list of the small projects implemented in Afghanistan and sponsored by various donors is available here.
↑11	In addition, the Asian Development Bank funded a joint master degree programme of integrated water management implemented by the Kabul Polytechnic University and Griffith University of Australia for the employees of the ministry of Energy and Water. Funds for this project were transferred to the Kabul Polytechnic University’s account from ADB at the start of the project, which meant that, after a three-month break following the takeover of the country by Taleban, the programme could resume as normal.
↑12	As UNEP was assisting NEPA in preparing the national communication report for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, it could continue this task without the Taleban government’s involvement in order to avoid a pause in climate change monitoring and fill the gap of submitting regular reports to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
