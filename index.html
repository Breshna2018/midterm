            <h3>worst droughts of the last two decades</h3>
            <p>Afghanistan is experiencing one of the worst droughts of the last two decades. Conditions are particularly severe 
                in the south, western and northwestern parts of the country. Water resources in these regions are severely reduced – 
                a major factor behind 19 million people – nearly half the country’s population – at crisis levels of food insecurity and poverty.
                The report maps out the drought and its affects, with detail on snow and rainfall, vegetation cover, groundwater and river flows,
                 harvests and livestock.</p>

            <h2>Global Warming and Afghanistan: Drought, hunger and thirst expected to worsen</h2>
            <p>While the nations of the world come together at the COP26 to seek solutions to climate change, Afghanistan is already suffering from global warming. One of the worst droughts in recent years has caused rainfed wheat crops to fail, led to plummeting livestock prices and shortages in drinking water. 19 million people – nearly half of the country’s population – are severely food insecure and require urgent assistance. AAN guest author Mohammad Assem Mayar,* a water resource management expert, maps out the severity of the drought and its effect on people and agriculture, explains how climate change will make drought in Afghanistan more common and looks at what should be done to mitigate their harm.

                <p>According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network’s (FEWS NET) snow cover monitoring maps, the shortfall of snow depth in Afghanistan on 1 March 2021 was even more extreme than in 2018, 
                    the third-worst drought in the last two decades. In this section, the author compares the current year’s data both with 
                    historical averages and the 2018 drought (see the past drought maps of Afghanistan here).
                    reduction in snow accumulation over winter decreases overall water volume and its distribution throughout the year.
                     Figure 2 shows snow water volumes – the amount of water in existing snow in the catchment – for the Helmand sub-basin in 2021
                      compared to 2020, 2018, and the long-term average, maximum and minimum circumstances, based on data since the year 2000. As 
                      
                      can be observed, the snow water volume in January 2021 is significantly lower than the usual average and at record lows from February 2021 onward, 
                      amounting to only 22 per cent of the usual snow water volume in the basin on 4 March. Water from the sub-basin drains to the Helmand River,
                       then crosses the border to Iran (and is at the root of a century-old conflict between the two countries, see here and here). 
                   depicts the streamflow graph for the lower Helmand station in 2021 in contrast to 2020 and normal circumstances. 
                   This graph shows a significant reduction in river flows in 2021 to extremely low levels (the green line), with shortages
                    reportedly affecting Afghanistan and Iran – Tehran has accused Afghanistan of cutting off its water supplies from the Kamal Khan dam reservoir (see this Pajhwok report). 
                   Drought-induced water scarcity affects agricultural productivity, livestock production, the availability of drinking water
                    and the capacity of hydroelectric power plants. In Afghanistan, agriculture, which consumes most of the water, is most severely affected.impoerant

                <p>Farmers across Afghanistan have been hit hard by drought and fighting in recent years. In this report, we look at how this has
                     affected agriculture in one province, Kandahar,
                     famous for its fruit production. Much of the fruit crop is – or should be – exported, yet the frequent and 
                     unpredictable closure of crossings into Pakistan has been an additional headache for farmers and exporters in the province. 
                     Those trying to dry and process food crops in Kandahar’s industrial park have also been hit by its collapse since the takeover
                      of Afghanistan by the Taleban. AAN’s Ali Mohammad Sabawoon has been hearing from farmers and others about the woes affecting Kandahar’s agricultural economy.</p>
